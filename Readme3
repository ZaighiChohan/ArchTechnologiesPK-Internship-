📌 Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using the Mall Customers dataset.
The goal is to group customers into different segments based on their demographic and purchasing behavior.
Segmentation helps businesses identify target groups for marketing, promotions, and customer relationship management.

🎯 Objectives

Preprocess customer dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale numerical features).

Apply KMeans clustering to segment customers.

Determine the optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

Visualize the clusters in 2D (Income vs Spending, Age vs Spending).

Profile and interpret each cluster for business insights.

📂 Dataset

File: Mall_Customers.csv

Columns:

CustomerID → Unique ID of customer

Gender → Male / Female

Age → Age of customer

Annual Income (k$) → Annual income in thousands of dollars

Spending Score (1-100) → Spending score assigned by the mall

⚙️ Preprocessing

Removed duplicates and missing values.

Encoded Gender (Male = 1, Female = 0).

Created additional features:

Income_per_Age

Spend_per_Income

Standardized features using StandardScaler.

🔍 Clustering

Chose KMeans as clustering algorithm.

Used Elbow Method and Silhouette Score → optimal k = 6.

Each customer assigned a cluster label (0–5).

📊 Visualizations

Elbow and Silhouette plots.

Scatter plots of:

Annual Income vs Spending Score

Age vs Spending Score

Cluster centers in original feature units.

🧩 Cluster Profiles

Premium Big Spenders → High income, high spending.

Value Big Spenders → Medium income, high spending.

Affluent Mid Spenders → High income, moderate spending.

High Income, Low Spend → Wealthy but conservative spenders.

Budget-Conscious → Low income, low spending.

Mid-Market Customers → Average income and spending.

📈 Insights

High-value customers (Clusters 0 & 1) should be prioritized for loyalty programs.

Affluent but low-spending customers (Cluster 3) represent untapped potential.

Budget-conscious groups (Cluster 4) respond well to discounts and promotions.

Mid-market customers (Cluster 5) provide steady revenue.
