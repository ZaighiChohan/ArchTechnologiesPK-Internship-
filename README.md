## 📌 Description
This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning models.  
The dataset contains details like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.
## 📂 Files
- `dataset.csv` - Titanic passenger dataset  
- `Task1_TITANIC_PREDICTION.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with full analysis and model
- ## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `Task1_TITANIC_PREDICTION.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run all cells to load data, preprocess, and train models.  
3. The notebook will display evaluation metrics and plots.
## 📊 Results
- Data preprocessing performed (handling missing values, encoding categorical data).  
- Machine learning models applied to classify survival.  
- Results visualized using plots and accuracy scores.
