## 📌 Description
This project predicts the stock prices of Apple using historical data.  
The model uses machine learning techniques to capture patterns and forecast future prices.

## 📂 Files
- `apple_share_price.csv` - Historical Apple stock price dataset  
- `Taskstockprediction.py` - Python script for training and testing model  
- `Task2 model output.png` - Visualization of predicted vs actual stock prices  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter / Python Scripts

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Run `Taskstockprediction.py` using Python:  
   python Taskstockprediction.py
The script will load the dataset, preprocess it, train a predictive model, and generate plots.

The output plot will be saved as Task2 model output.png.

📊 Results
Preprocessing of stock price data performed.

Model trained to predict stock closing prices.

Visualization shows comparison of predicted vs actual values.
